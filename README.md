# My training project

Solutions to various programming challenges in Java and C++

## Currently solved challenges

* [Trie implementation](java/src/main/java/ru/nk/training/Trie.java)

    Implemetation of Trie data structure designed to add words, count number of words by specified prefix, and to obtaining words that starts with the specified prefix.

* [Count stars](java/src/main/java/ru/nk/training/StarCounter.java)
    
    For this problem, you should write a program which counts the number of stars visible in an bitmap image. An image consists of pixels, and each pixel is either black or white (represented by the characters # and -, respectively).
    All black pixels are considered to be part of the sky, and each white pixel is considered to be part of a star. White pixels that are adjacent vertically or horizontally are part of the same star.

* [Checking intersection of rectangles](java/src/main/java/ru/nk/training/RectangleIntersectionChecker.java)

    You are given two rectangles, each defined by an upper-left (UL) corner and
    a lower-right (LR) corner. Both rectanglesâ€™ edges will always be parallel
    to the x or y axis. Write a function that determines whether the two rectangles overlap.

* [Least Recently Used (LRU) cache](java/src/main/java/ru/nk/training/LruCache.java)

* [Left rotation of an array](java/src/main/java/ru/nk/training/LeftRotation.java)

    A left rotation operation on an array of size N shifts each of the array's elements 1 unit to the left. Given an array of integers and a number, k, perform k left rotations on the array.
